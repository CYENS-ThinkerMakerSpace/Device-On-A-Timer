# Device-On-A-Timer
At a specific time of day, turn on a mains-powered device.

This project uses the ESP-32 microcontroller, and it was used to control the Art Installation of our resident artist [Mihalis Shammas] on a daily schedule.

In detail, the ESP-32 turns On or Off periodically, a relay that is connected to an AC motor.
